# DivLab

A collaborative effort between:

### `Zachary Resnick, Joonho Han, Elliot Gonzalez :)`

## Tech Stack

Technologies used in this project:

### `React`

https://reactjs.org/

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React will efficiently update and render only the components that need to be rerendered.

React is component-based and allows for each component to manage their own state.

### `Redux`

https://redux.js.org/

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for state management.

Redux works together with React and Firestore to build complex user interfaces.

and retrieve data from the database, while easily managing state.

### `Firebase`

https://firebase.google.com/

Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform that offers a variety of services to help develop high-quality apps.

Firebase Authentication is used to allow users to sign in and keep their data unique.

### `Firestore`

https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/

Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud Platform.

Firestore is a NoSQL database where data is stored in documents, and these documents are stored in collections.

Firestore keeps data in sync and keeps data up to date.

### `HTML5 Drag and Drop`

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API

HTML5 Drag and Drop interfaces enable applications to use drag-and-drop features in browsers.

By specifying draggable and droppable elements, users can easily select a draggable element and move it to a droppable element.

HTML5 Drag and Drop is used to move components into containers in the workspace.

### `React-Grid-Layout`

https://github.com/STRML/react-grid-layout

React-Grid-Layout is a grid layout system for React.

React-Grid-Layout is responsive and supports breakpoints. Breakpoint layouts can be provided by the user or autogenerated.

React-Grid-Layout allows users to drag and resize containers in the workspace.

### `Semantic UI React`

https://react.semantic-ui.com/

Semantic UI React is the React integration for Semantic UI.

Semantic UI is a modern front-end development framework. Is offers a sleek and subtle design that provides a lightweight user experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

<!-- ### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information. -->

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

<!-- ### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
